        <h2>Social Implications</h2>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies make it easier for people in different countries to pay each other, negating financial borders currently controlled by banks and governments. Emergency aid, welfare, fines, and many more financial areas are open for development. Some disadvantages are that nowhere has really fully adapted the use of crypto and with thousands of differnt coins all promising to accomplish different things, I would argue that FULLY understanding crypto take a good amount of time and effort.  </p>

        <h2>Economic Implications</h2>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoins are enjoyed because they provide a more fresh and digital-based type of currency. These sites don’t utilize a third party to interact with transactions. This allows for transactions to go directly from buyer to seller. Bitcoin has also been applauded for its many benefits such as low transaction fees and faster processing. Which explains why in recent years, there have been hundreds of billions of dollars flowing into the new forms of currency. 
           Blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrency, has also finally taken a step towards the mainstream.There are many reasons why the Goverment's have chosen not to adapt crypto as it is a threat to their already existing currency and it's stability. Crypto also would help provide security for users with unique walet ID's, and maybe help hedge against inflation.</p>

        <h2>Political Implications</h2>
        <p>While not without ideology, crypto itself is not inherently left or right wing. You can like or hate it no matter your political persuasion. But increasingly, a partisan divide can be seen forming around it. The right has rushed to embrace crypto and stake its ground, while the left is shunning it and ceding any claims. At times, it might make little sense. But it is happening.
         with limited time in the spotlight some parties from the left and right have chosen to share where they think crypto's future could head.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p> Overall, I believe that as crypto becomes more mainstream, it will also become more polarizing. And perhaps, more vulnerable to political trends. There have been many uses demonstrating the security of blockchain technology both in good and bad ways. A good way is that people have the security to send money across countries to loved ones avoiding government fees and traceability.  A negative example of this is the Netflix movie “silkroad” where people would buy and sell drugs online and use bitcoin as currency. There are many threats to federal banks and countries when adapting this new form of digital money, so for now I say that we still have a while before crypto is more heavily adapted worldwide.</p>
